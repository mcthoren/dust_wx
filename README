This is started with the gist from here:
https://gist.github.com/geoffwatts/b0b488b5a5257223ed53

and is for the nova PM sensor SDS011.

This code can be found in the following places:
 + https://github.com/mcthoren/dust_wx			<--code
 + https://wx3.slackology.net/plots/dust_wx.html	<--page
 + https://wx3.slackology.net/				<--code, page, plots, data

This is the datasheet i've been using:
http://ecksteinimg.de/Datasheet/SDS011%20laser%20PM2.5%20sensor%20specification-V1.3.pdf

To get started with dust.pl on debian/raspbian, one will need sth like the following:
 + apt install libdevice-serialport-perl

Most of this repo is not necessary for actually collecting and plotting data from the sensor. One really only needs the dust.py script to be up and going. The rest of this noise is explained below:

LICENSE				lic
README				readme
data				directory where data is written.
dust.pl				experimental perl version.
dust.py				<-- This is the only real necessary file. This collects and graphs data.
dust_bars.gnuplot		Gnuplot file for doing up daily bar graph of average pm amounts
dust_raw.pl			Experimental perl version using just the raw serial device.
dust_stats			perl script for computing daily average dust.
dust_stats_wrap			wrapper script to be called from cron for doing the daily avg pm bar graph.
dust_wx_index.html.template	template for the webpage
plots				directory where graphs are written.
